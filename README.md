# Ecommerce and Web Analytics
This project focused on Maven Fuzzy Factory, a thriving online store specializing in toy sales. As a Data Analyst, my mission was to provide valuable insights to stakeholders and help to make data-driven decisions that benefit the business based on available data.

## Website Performance and Traffic Sources Analysis
In the first assignment, I helped to prepare a crucial presentation for the company's board, analysing website performance data.

## Customers and Products Analysis
In the second assignment, my analysis provided key metrics to support decision-making for a new manager.

All assignments follow a consistent structure, making it convenient to review all the key elements in one place.
